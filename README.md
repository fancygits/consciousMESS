# README

CONSCIOUS/mess is a website for posting messages in reverse chronological order.  Anyone can post a new mesasge (called a "ripple") -- there is no authentication, just a list of quotes, rants, notes-to-remember, etc. with the newest showing first.

The website is based on a single table, Ripples, with the following columns:

name: the name, pseudonym, alias, etc., of the person leaving the message.  It can be anything, but it can not be blank.
url: any valid url the person wants to associate with the message.  This is optional.
message: the message they're writing.  It can not be blank.
